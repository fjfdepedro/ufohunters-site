 			<h3>About UFO Hunters</h3><br/>
			<blockquote>
				<p>An unidentified flying object, or UFO, in its most general definition, is any apparent anomaly in the sky (or near or on the ground, but observed hovering, landing, or departing into the sky) that is not readily identifiable as any known object or phenomenon by visual observation and/or use of associated instrumentation such as radar. These anomalies were referred to popularly as "flying saucers" or "flying discs" during the late 1940s and early 1950s.‚Äù</p>

         <p>That is the wikipedia's definition of Unidentified Flying Object. ufo-hunters.com collects a huge data set of sightings all over the world. Our main purpose is to collaborate spreading objective UFO data. We thank the work of organizations such as NUFORC that investigates the reports and are a source of inspiration to us.</p>
 
			<h3>Who's behind ufo-hunter.com ?</h3><br/>
 			
 			<p>Behind ufo-hunters.com there are two enthusiast guys of both extraterrestrial life and new technologies. Our first purpose was to collaborate in the dissemination of UFO Data as we found the large data set available at infochimps.com: <a href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/60000-documented-ufo-sightings-with-text-descriptions-and-metada" target="_blank">60,000+ DOCUMENTED UFO SIGHTINGS WITH TEXT DESCRIPTIONS AND METADATA"</a></p>

 			<p>Our secondary purpose was to experiment with new technologies, and had the challenge to have this project in production in a few weeks. At this point we know we choose the best possible stack and are proud to announce that all the resources and technologies we used are open source.

 			<p>All UFO data was imported into a <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> database</a>, currently version 2.4.3, with geospatial "2dsphere" indexes that considerably ease all the stuff with coordinates and geolocation.</p>

 			<p>The design of this site is based on a free design of <a href="http://www.araynordesign.co.uk">ARaynorDesign</a>.</p>

 			<p>This site is built with an incredibly powerful web framework called <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>, that uses the more eloquent and elegant programming language we've ever used.</p>

 			<p>All the images in this site are available at <a href="www.openclipart.org" target="_blank">OpenClipArt.org</a></p>
